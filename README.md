# porto-allocation-rl

Our project is to optimize portofolio allocation using reinforcement learning methods. We aim to find the best combination of allocation between 2 different asset classes X and Y as a risk management solution. We consider both returns and risk as our performance criteria of the agent. Through this agent, we aim to capture insights and policies from historical data of these 2 asset classes.
